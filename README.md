NRC Word-Emotion Association Lexicon 
The [NRC Emotion Lexicon](http://saifmohammad.com/WebPages/NRC-Emotion-Lexicon.htm) is a list of English words and their associations with eight basic emotions (anger, fear, anticipation, trust, surprise, sadness, joy, and disgust) and two sentiments (negative and positive). The annotations were manually done by crowdsourcing.
## Persian Translation of The Lexicon
There is an Excel file that contains the translation (Google Translate) of the english words (without complete coverage on all languages).I wrote a small code to combine the main text file (containing emotion annotations) and Excel translation file.
